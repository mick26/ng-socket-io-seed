# Angular Socket.io Seed


Brian Fords [Angular Socket-io Seed](https://github.com/btford/angular-socket-io-seed) program with:

* Jade removed
* All views rendered by Angular client
* Updated to Express version 4.x.x
* Updated to Socket.io V1.x


As Brian put it "Start an awesome app with AngularJS on the front, Socket.io + Express + Node on the back. This
project is an application skeleton for writing [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) apps that use
web sockets to add real-time functionality.

The seed app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Socket.io and Express
on the server."
